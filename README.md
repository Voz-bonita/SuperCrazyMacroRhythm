# Super Crazy Macro Rhythm

This project is a macro/hack for the game Super Crazy Castle Rhythm, a rhythm game in Guitar Hero style with 4 notes to pressed in either single presses or holds. The main idea is to record the songs of the game, extract every frame to an image of the note hit area, map the inputs and then replay them.

This is still experimental and it is known not to be perfect.

Have fun.
